  complete and up to date. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance 
  with Section 7 (1) of the German Telemedia Act. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we as a service provider are not

  always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations 
  at the time the link was created. No illegal content was discernible at the time the link was created. A permanent
